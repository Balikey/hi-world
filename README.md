Quitting is not an option 
I never knew a day will come for me to become a backend
developer with no knowledge of what it's all about but i
decided to give it a try. Learning and hearing new words
like lucid, HNG,GitHub and clubhouse, nearly made me to
quite.But on getting to the GitHub,the tension began to
reduce, though i had difficulty to upload my profile
photo. Thanks to Google and other tutorial videos i have
been enlightened.
